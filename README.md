# ColorClash
**Idea**

"Color Clash" is a hypercasual mobile game that pits two players against each other in a vibrant, fast-paced color-throwing battle. Set on a simple but dynamic grid, the game features a blue player at the bottom and a red player at the top of the screen. Utilizing a slingshot or drag-and-shoot mechanic, players hurl color balls to paint objects scattered across the grid. The challenge lies in outmaneuvering the opponent and dominating the grid with their respective colors within a set time frame. The game is visually engaging, with bright colors and smooth animations that make the action feel lively and dynamic. The intuitive controls ensure that players can quickly pick up the game and start having fun, while the competitive nature keeps them hooked. The game's straightforward mechanics and visually stimulating gameplay ensure it remains accessible and engaging for players of all ages.

**Goal**

The ultimate aim of the player in "Color Clash" is to paint more objects in their color than their opponent within the given time frame. Players must strategically and skillfully use the slingshot or drag-and-shoot mechanic to cover as many objects as possible in their color, while also defending their own painted objects from being overtaken by the opponent. The thrill of rapid competition, coupled with the satisfaction of seeing the screen filled with one's color, makes "Color Clash" both fun and entertaining. The game's fast pace and simple controls offer immediate gratification, while the competitive element provides a compelling reason for players to keep coming back. The game is designed to be fun, entertaining, and satisfying due to several key factors:
1. Competitive Edge: The head-to-head competition drives players to improve their skills and strategies to outpaint their opponent.
2. Visual Satisfaction: Seeing the grid fill up with one's color provides a gratifying visual experience.
3. Simple Mechanics: The slingshot or drag-and-drop mechanic is easy to learn but offers depth in terms of aiming and timing.
4. Time Pressure: The limited time frame adds a layer of excitement and urgency to the gameplay.

**Build**

The game is built using the Unity Mobile 3D mode. The version of Unity that is used is 2022.3.37f1.
